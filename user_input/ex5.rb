# Write a program that prints 'Launch School is the best!' repeatedly until
# a certain number of lines have been printed. The program should obtain the
# number of lines from the user, and should insist that at least 3
# lines are printed.

# For now, just use #to_i to convert the input value to an Integer,
# and check that result instead of trying to insist on a valid
# number; validation of numeric input is a topic with a fair number
# of edge conditions that are beyond the scope of this exercise.

# input.times { puts 'Launch School is the best!' }

input = nil
puts 'Please enter a number: '
loop do
  input = gets.chomp.to_i
  break if input > 3

  puts 'Please enter a number greater than 3'
end

input.times { puts 'Launch School is the best!' }
