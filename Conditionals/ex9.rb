# In the code below, number is randomly assigned a number between 0 and 9.
# Then, an if statement is used to print "5 is a cool number!" or "Other
# numbers are cool too!" based on the value of number.

# number = rand(10)

# if number = 5
#   puts '5 is a cool number!'
# else
#   puts 'Other numbers are cool too!'
# end

number = rand(10)

if number == 5
